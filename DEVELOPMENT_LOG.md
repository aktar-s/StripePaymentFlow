## Architecture Decisions

### Data Storage Strategy
**Decision**: File-based JSON storage (`storage-data.json`)  
**Rationale**: Simplified deployment, persistent across restarts, no database setup required  
**Trade-offs**: Limited scalability, single-instance constraint  
**Date**: June 28, 2025

### Stripe API Integration
**Decision**: Stripe API v2024-06-20 with payment intents  
**Rationale**: Latest stable API, superior to legacy charges API  
**Implementation**: Complete webhook integration for real-time updates  
**Date**: June 28, 2025

### Frontend State Management
**Decision**: TanStack Query for server state, React useState for local state  
**Rationale**: Optimal caching, automatic refetching, minimal complexity  
**Alternative Considered**: Redux (rejected due to complexity)  
**Date**: June 28, 2025

## Critical Issues Resolved

### 1. Automatic Payment Creation (CRITICAL)
**Issue**: Payments being created automatically on page load instead of user action  
**Root Cause**: Payment intent creation in useEffect without user interaction  
**Solution**: Two-step process with setup form before payment creation  
**Impact**: Prevented unwanted test charges  
**Date**: June 28, 2025

### 2. Currency Conversion Bugs (HIGH)
**Issue**: Amounts showing as £0.01 instead of £1.00  
**Root Cause**: Double conversion between pence and pounds  
**Solution**: Standardized conversion logic throughout application  
**Impact**: Accurate payment amounts displayed  
**Date**: June 28, 2025

### 3. Data Persistence Loss (HIGH)
**Issue**: Transaction history lost on server restart  
**Root Cause**: In-memory storage without persistence  
**Solution**: Implemented PersistentStorage class with JSON file backend  
**Impact**: All transactions now permanently stored  
**Date**: June 28, 2025

### 4. Live Mode UI Confusion (MEDIUM)
**Issue**: Test card information appearing in Live mode payment form  
**Root Cause**: Static UI elements not responsive to mode changes  
**Solution**: Dynamic form reinitialization based on current mode  
**Impact**: Clear mode distinction for users  
**Date**: June 28, 2025
